# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#  Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#  1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#  2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#  o	Addition
#  o	Subtraction
#  o	Multiplication
#  o	Division
#   3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

a = int(input("Enter a number"))
b = int(input("Enter a number"))

addition= (a + b)
substraction = (a - b)
Multiplication = (a * b)
Division = (a / b)
print(f"Addition:{addition}")
print(f"Substraction:{substraction}")
print(f"Multiplication:{Multiplication}")
print(f"Division:{Division}")
